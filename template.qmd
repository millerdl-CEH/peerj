# Introduction

Your introduction goes here! Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

If you have a question, please use the help menu in the top right of the screen to get in touch. When your article is complete, use the "Submit to PeerJ" button in the topbar to send your files to PeerJ.

## About PeerJ

PeerJ is an award-winning open access publisher covering the biological and medical sciences.  PeerJ provides authors with multiple publication venues, including \textit{PeerJ} and \textit{PeerJ Computer Science} (peer-reviewed academic journals). See https://peerj.com/about/publications/ for more information.

# Some Quarto Examples
\label{sec:examples}

Use section and subsection commands to organize your document. Quarto handles all the formatting and numbering automatically. Use ref and label commands for cross-references.

## Figures and Tables

You can include images via the usual Markdown mechanism. The following generates @fig-view below.

```
![An example image.](view.jpg){#fig-view}
```

![An example image.](view.jpg){#fig-view}

Note that the label for figures must start with `fig-` to enable cross-referencing. See \url{https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html} for more information.

Tables also use the familiar Markdown syntax, for example @tbl-widgets.


| Item    |  Quantity |
|---------|:----------|
| Widgets |    42     |
| Gadgets |    13     |

: An example table. {#tbl-widgets}


As with figures, table labels must start with `tbl-`.

## Citations

Quarto formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use `@` for an inline citation, like @Figueredo:2009dg, and `[@...]` for a citation in parentheses [@Figueredo:2009dg].

## Mathematics

Quarto is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
$$S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i$$
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

## Lists

You can make lists with automatic numbering \dots

1. Like this,
2. and like this.

\dots or bullet points \dots

- Like this,
- and like this.

\dots or with words and descriptions \dots
\begin{description}
\item[Word] Definition
\item[Concept] Explanation
\item[Idea] Text
\end{description}

We hope you find write Quarto useful for your PeerJ submission, and please let us know if you have any feedback. Further examples with dummy text are included in the following pages.
